# html-css-intro

This repository is a workshop companion and can be used as a template to work through topics as they are covered. The 'main' branch is intentionally empty with the exception of README.md. Progress through workshop content is reflected in branches with a completed version reflected in the 'final-solution' branch.

## Branches

- step-01-initialize

> This branch includes an index.html file with a base HTML template (html, head, title, body). This step introduces the basic structure of an HTML page and leads into common HTML elements.

- step-02-html

> This branch introduces common HTML elements (e.g. h1, p, img, div, span, header, footer, ul, ol, etc.) populated in index.html.

- step-03-css

> This branch includes CSS files to introduce approaches for page layout and styling.

- final-solution

> This branch reflects the workshop content in a completed state. 

## Prerequisites

To participate in the workshop, we recommend signing up for a free GitHub account if you don't already have one. With the GitHub account, you will be able to copy this repository and save your work as we walk through workshop topics. In addition, you can use your GitHub credentials to sign into cloud sandbox enviroments such as CloudSandbox, CodePen.io, StackBlitz, and Replit where you can see live previews of code you are editing without the need for complicated development environment configuration. We will be focusing on GitHub and CloudSandbox for this workshop but see the Cloud IDEs section in the References below for other excellent cloud sandbox environments that are available.

1) GitHub: https://github.com

- Signup: https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home

- Sign In: https://github.com/login

2) CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io

> You can create unique credentials for CodeSandbox but there is also an option to log in with your GitHub credentials. You can sign in with a CodeSandbox account or use the 'Sign in with GitHub' button on the sign in screen to use your GitHub credentials.

- Sign In: https://codesandbox.io/signin


## Cloning the Repository

1) Sign in to your GitHub account (https://github.com/login).
2) Navigate to https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro.
3) Click the green 'Use this template' button to copy the repository to your GitHub account. 

> Clicking the 'Use this template' button is similar to forking the repository except that you don't get the previous commit history from the source repository like you would when forking the repository.

4) Once a copy of this repository is in your GitHub space, you can clone your copy to your local development environment or fork it in a cloud IDE such as CloudSandbox.


## CodeSandbox

Using CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io), you can open your copy of the workshop repository in CodeSandbox to immediately see the results of updates you make to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Although changes made in CodeSandbox are not automatically committed back to the GitHub repository, the CodeSandbox project can be configured to link back to your GitHub repository as a branch pull request.


### Preview and Fork a GitHub Repository

CodeSandbox has an import wizard that lets you preview a public GitHub repository. Once the preview loads, you will then have the option to fork the repository into your CodeSandbox environment.

1) Open the 'Import from GitHub' wizard - https://codesandbox.io/s/github
2) Paste the source repository's path (https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro.git) or the URL for a specific branch (e.g. https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro/tree/final-solution) into the 'Insert GitHub URL...' input box within the wizard.
3) Click the 'Open Sandbox' button
4) You can preview the sandbox view of the repository in CodeSandbox but you won't be able to make updates unless you fork the repository.
5) Click the 'Fork' button in the left-hand panel to fork the repository into your CodeSandbox account. From that point, updates will be reflected in CodeSandbox but not in your GitHub repository.
6) Link the sandbox to your GitHub repository using the GitHub panel in the left-most side panel to create a pull request and merge updates made from CodeSandbox back to your GitHub repository.


### Fork a GitHub Repository

You can also fork a GitHub repository from the Repositories screen on the CodeSandbox Dashboard. 

1) From the CodeSandbox Dashboard, click the 'Repositories' menu item (https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/repositories).
2) Click the 'Import Repositories' button.
3) In the 'Import from GitHub' section of the 'Import Project' panel, paste the source repository's path (https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro.git) or the URL for a specific branch (e.g. https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro/tree/final-solution) into the 'GitHub Repository URL...' input box.
4) Click 'Import and Fork'. From that point, updates will be reflected in CodeSandbox but not in your GitHub repository.
6) Link the sandbox to your GitHub repository using the GitHub panel in the left-most side panel to create a pull request and merge updates made from CodeSandbox back to your GitHub repository.

## Cloud Sandboxes/IDEs

### CodePen.io: https://codepen.io

CodePen.io is an excellent sandbox option for exploring HTML/CSS/JavaScript capabilities. Signing in is similar to CodeSandbox where you can create individual credentials or sign in using your GitHub credentials. A CodePen.io sandbox gives you a single HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code block to build with. You have the ability to configure your sandbox and include additional libraries to enhance your exploration.


### StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com

StackBlitz has a similar feel to CodeSandbox and has similar sign in options. For purposes of this workshop, we felt CodeSandbox had a couple more flexible options such as support for uploading images in the free tier. StackBlitz has a wide variety of pre-configured sandbox templates that let quickly spin up projects such as Angular, React, VueJs, and many others.


### Replit: https://replit.com

Replit follows the previous sandboxes as it has similar sign in options. In addition to providing HTML/CSS/JavaScript project templates, it also provides templates for other languates such as Python, VB, C++, and many others.
