This repository is a workshop companion and can be used as a template to work through topics as they are covered.

- step-03-css

> This branch includes CSS files to introduce approaches for page layout and HTML element styling.

- final-solution

## Cloning the Repository

1) Sign in to your GitHub account
2) If not already here, navigate to https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro
3) Click the green 'Use this template' button to copy the repository to your GitHub account. 

> Clicking the 'Use this template' button is similar to forking the repository except that you don't get the previous commit history from the source repository like you would when forking the repository.

4) Once a copy of this repository is in your GitHub space, you can clone your copy to your local development environment or fork it in a cloud IDE such as CloudSandbox. For the purposes of this workshop, we will be using CodeSandbox.


## CodeSandbox

Using CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io), you can open your copy of the workshop repository in CodeSandbox to immediately see the results of updates you make to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Although changes made in CodeSandbox are not automatically committed back to the GitHub repository, the CodeSandbox project can be configured to link back to your GitHub repository as a branch pull request.


### Preview and Fork a GitHub Repository

CodeSandbox has an import wizard that lets you preview a public GitHub repository. Once the preview loads, you will then have the option to fork the repository into your CodeSandbox environment.

1) Open the 'Import from GitHub' wizard - https://codesandbox.io/s/github
2) Paste the source repository's path (https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro.git) or the URL for a specific branch (e.g. https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro/tree/final-solution) into the 'Insert GitHub URL...' input box within the wizard.
3) Click the 'Open Sandbox' button
4) You can preview the sandbox view of the repository in CodeSandbox but you won't be able to make updates unless you fork the repository.
5) Click the 'Fork' button in the left-hand panel to fork the repository into your CodeSandbox account. From that point, updates will be reflected in CodeSandbox but not in your GitHub repository.
6) Link the sandbox to your GitHub repository using the GitHub panel in the left-most side panel to create a pull request and merge updates made from CodeSandbox back to your GitHub repository.


### Fork a GitHub Repository

You can also fork a GitHub repository from the Repositories screen on the CodeSandbox Dashboard. 

1) From the CodeSandbox Dashboard, click the 'Repositories' menu item (https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/repositories).
2) Click the 'Import Repositories' button.
3) In the 'Import from GitHub' section of the 'Import Project' panel, paste the source repository's path (https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro.git) or the URL for a specific branch (e.g. https://github.com/KPMG-Mike/html-css-intro/tree/final-solution) into the 'GitHub Repository URL...' input box.
4) Click 'Import and Fork'. From that point, updates will be reflected in CodeSandbox but not in your GitHub repository.
6) Link the sandbox to your GitHub repository using the GitHub panel in the left-most side panel to create a pull request and merge updates made from CodeSandbox back to your GitHub repository.
